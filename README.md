### Task 2 (Tuesday): "Implementing a File Upload Endpoint"

    - Goal: Build a REST API endpoint to handle file uploads.
    - Description:
        - Extend the server from Task 1 (or start a new repo) to accept file uploads via multipart/form-data.
        - Write the uploaded file to disk and respond with a success message.
        - This teaches handling HTTP POST requests, multipart parsing, and basic file I/O.
